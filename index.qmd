- Azure (AKS, Key Vault, CosmosDB, DevOps, Pipelines, etc.)

## Current Interest
- Data engineering / ML engineering, 

  Since I have quite a lot of experience in building API and data transformation, I always wonder how do my company process this kind of data, how they assess this data, how they give recommendation, etc. 
  Well, I have long journey ahead.
