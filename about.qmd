# title: "About"
---

Currently residing in Batam, Indonesia. And always want to travel the world.

## Current Interest
- Data engineering / ML engineering, 

  Since I have quite a lot of experience in building API and data transformation, I always wonder how do my company process this kind of data, how they assess this data, how they give recommendation, etc. 
  Well, I have long journey ahead.

- Japanese

  I **love** japanese culture, I think it's natural that I want to enjoy my movie, anime, music, comics and books without subtitle/translation. As we know, something almost always lost in translation.


## Side activity
- I created [salary calculator](https://github.com/rdnpradipta/salary-calculator-id) for Indonesian Worker.

  I know it's just only one simple website ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ But I have more plans for my upcoming projects!

- I love to play game occasionally.
