Recently, I saw years old meme about an instruction to commit and push your code before leaving the building in case of fire.

This is quite funny, and this might happens to all of us, I think I need to create a post for a reminder to always have alias **Fire**ðŸ”¥


![In case of fire? Git!](https://external-preview.redd.it/bh0w-o1ebM4FJDQemthTl3MI9tw6ShI7mRyYuTCyPzc.jpg?auto=webp&s=6be2b8336133ec068e4bc6e63e2033d0608688ca)


```bash
git config --global alias.fire \
'!sh -c "git checkout -b fire-{uid} && \
         git add -A && \
         git commit -m "FIRE" && \
         git push origin fire-{uid}"'
```

change the {uid} into something that is unique (such as email)
after successful addition of command above, we can just run:
```bash
git fire
```

OR we can just copy these commands, either we save it in alias or save it as fire(.bat), and add fire.bat into PATH. 
```bash
git checkout -b fire-{uid} && git add -A && git commit -m "FIRE" && git push origin fire-{uid}
```
then we can just run fire.bat in cmd.

At least, this will do.
The most important thing in case of fire is _**git out**_!
